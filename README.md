This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_system-requirements)
- [VSCode Dev Container Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:sfc-aqua/sfc-aqua.github.io.git
$ cd sfc-aqua.github.io
# open the cloned repository, if you install the 'code' command, you can do this
# see detail of the 'code' command is here
# https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line
$ code .
# or manually open it on visual studio code
```

then you can open the folder with the Dev Container.
Open command palette by `View > Command Palette` and then type and select `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.

## Getting Started

First, run install the dependencies. You can do it with your package manager, or run `direnv allow` under the project directory to use `nix-shell` if you're a nix user.

Then, execute the development server:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

To edit your profile on the Members page, open the `src/app/members/members-data.ts`, then edit/add your profile object appropriately under `const members: TMember[]`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

before commit your changes, you _must_ run:

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

to format your code.
