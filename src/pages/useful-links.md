# Links to Affiliated Groups

AQUA exists in a sea of overlapping, affiliated projects. Our members partipate, or participated, in the following organizations.

- [Murai / Nakamura / Kusumoto / Takashio / Van Meter / Uehara / Mitsugi / Nakazawa / Tezuka / Takeda / Okoshi Joint Research Group](http://rg.sfc.keio.ac.jp/) The umbrella group for supervising more than 100 undergraduates working broadly on computing, supervised by an entire army of grad students, research faculty and faculty, founded by Jun Murai and Hide Tokuda in 1990. AQUA is a KG (kenkyuu gundan) underneath RG.
- [WIDE Project](http://www.wide.ad.jp/) The group of researchers who brought the Internet to Japan. Still intensely active in Internet research, operations, education, governance and policy. There is an AQUA working group under WIDE, as well, which extends AQUA to include members from other universities and companies.
- [Quantum Internet Task Force](https://qitf.org) A multi-institutional collaboration working to build a Quantum Internet testbed here in Japan.
- [Keio University Quantum Computing Center](https://quantum.keio.ac.jp) Approximately 100 faculty, staff, students and corporate researchers stationed at Keio working broadly on quantum computing.
- [Keio Faculty of Science and Technology Itoh Group](http://www.appi.keio.ac.jp/Itoh_group/) The research group of Professor Kohei M. Itoh. (He is now president of the university, so his group is currently quiescent.)
- [Keio Faculty of Science and Technology Satoh Group](https://sites.google.com/view/satoh-quantum-computing-lab) The research group of Associate Professor Takahiko Satoh. Satoh is one of the first AQUA alumni and a continuing collaborator.
- [ONLINE COURSE "Understanding Quantum Computers" (2 October 2017~)](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/intro-to-quantum-computing) Our first online course, at FutureLearn.
- [Quantum Academy of Science and Technology](https://qacademy.jp/en/) The group headed by Prof. Kae Nemoto of OIST, creating a set of online courses to build undergraduate degrees in quantum. Our responsibility is quantum communications. Three of our courses are available there.
- [JFLI](https://jfli.cnrs.fr/) The Japan-France Laboratory for Informatics.
- [FIRST Project](https://web.archive.org/web/20140407083648/http://first-quantum.net/) The FIRST Project ran from approximately April 2010 to March 2014, and seeded much of our own growth and the growth of quantum in Japan. The website has been offline for years; the link goes to the Internet Archive. Flash is required to view, unfortunately.
