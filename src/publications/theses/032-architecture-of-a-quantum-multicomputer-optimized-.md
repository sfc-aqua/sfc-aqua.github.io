Rodney Van Meter, **_Architecture of a Quantum Multicomputer Optimized for Shor's Factoring Algorithm_**, Ph.D. thesis, Keio University Faculty of Science and Technology, Sept. 2006. [available in PDF](/publications/van-meter-thesis-final-a4.pdf). Also on the arXiv as [quant-ph/0607065](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0607065) in a very slightly different form, using four slightly reduced-resolution images to create a _much_ small PostScript file.
