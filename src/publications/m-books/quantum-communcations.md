Michal Hajdušek and Rodney Van Meter, [Quantum Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02367)

> The second quantum revolution has been picking up momentum over the last decade. Quantum technologies are starting to attract more attention from governments, private companies, investors, and public. The ability to control individual quantum systems for the purpose of information processing and communication is no longer a theoretical dream, but is steadily becoming routine in laboratories and startups around the world. With this comes the need to educate the future generation of quantum engineers. This textbook is a companion to our video lectures on Overview of Quantum Communications from the Q-Leap Education project known as Quantum Academy of Science and Technology. It is a gentle introduction to quantum networks, and is suitable for use as a textbook for undergraduate students of diverse background. No prior knowledge of quantum physics or quantum information is assumed. Exercises are included in each chapter.
