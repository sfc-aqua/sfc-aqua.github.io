    The second quantum revolution has been picking up momentum over the last decade.
    Quantum technologies are starting to attract more attention from governments,
    private companies, investors, and public. The ability to control individual quantum
    systems for the purpose of information processing and communication is no longer
    a theoretical dream, but is steadily becoming routine in laboratories and startups
    around the world. With this comes the need to educate the future generation of
    quantum engineers. This textbook is a companion to our video lectures on Overview
    of Quantum Communications from the Q-Leap Education project known as Quantum
    Academy of Science and Technology. It is a gentle introduction to quantum networks,
    and is suitable for use as a textbook for undergraduate students of diverse background.
    No prior knowledge of quantum physics or quantum information is assumed. Exercises
    are included in each chapter.

  <br /> Quantum networks build on entanglement and quantum measurement to achieve
  tasks that are beyond the reach of classical systems. Using quantum effects, we
  can detect the presence of eavesdroppers, raise the sensitivity of scientific instruments
  such as telescopes, or teleport quantum data from one location to another. Long-distance
  entanglement can be used to execute important tasks such as Byzantine agreement
  and leader election in fewer rounds of communication than classical systems, improving
  the efficiency of operations that are critical in distributed systems. ISBN: 978-1-84821-537-5
