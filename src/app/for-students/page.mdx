# For Students

## Joining AQUA (current SFC undergrads)

We welcome (almost) anyone to join AQUA at (almost) any time. (Credit toward graduation requires formally joining on a semester boundary!) If you are interested in joining us, please contact us. In the fall semester of 2023 we have meetings on Thursdays second and third period (1110-1430). Laboratory:[ΔN211](access.html) Please check the main [RG landing page](https://rg.sfc.keio.ac.jp/) or [Portal](https://portal.sfc.wide.ad.jp) (login required) for more information.

To receive credit toward graduation, students should register for the kenkyuukai (seminar) of Prof. Van Meter, Prof. Kusumoto, or any of the other RG faculty.

## Joining AQUA (prospective new graduate students)

Contacting Prof. Van Meter is both the right thing, and sometimes difficult. You may find it more reliable to contact one of the project faculty or current graduate students first. See the [Members page](members) for all contact information.

Prof. Van Meter has [a rather out-of-date](https://web.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~rdv/study.html) page on recommendations for planning to join AQUA as a graduate student. Read it first, but don't trust it all, and you will find that most of the links are busted.

## Quantum Classes

Quantum classes for undergraduates by Prof. Van Meter. Currently (2023) both are offered in the fall. In 2023, QIP is in Japanese for the first time, and Quantum Internet is offered in English -- as far as we are aware, the very first Quantum Internet course for undergraduates anywhere in the world! (Seeing complete syllabus will require a Keio login.)

- [Quantum Internet](https://syllabus.sfc.keio.ac.jp/courses/2023_47917?locale=en)

For graduate students, Prof. Naoki Yamamoto, Center Chair of the Keio Quantum Computing Center, teaches valuable classes at the Yagami campus.

## Recommended Non-Quantum Classes

At minimum, undergrads should take the following:

- Linear Algebra
- Probability or Statistics (or both)
- Calculus
- Optimization Theory
- Introduction to the Internet
- Operating Systems
- Computer Architecture
- Algorithm Science
- Network Architecture (for those in the quantum communications sub-group)
- security and cryptography classes as available

Graduate students should take the following:

- Design and Implementation of System Software
- Conceptual Framework (CI)
- Optical Networking (Prof. Tsuda, Yagami campus; not offered in 2023)

## Recommended Texts

The group owns at least one copy of most of these books, and I'm happy to buy new books we think are valuable. (I'm much less happy about buying new copies of old books because we've lost them.)

- Robert S. Sutor, Dancing with Qubits

  "Mike and Ike", regarded as the standard graduate-level textbook. Not easy going for beginners, but great stuff.
